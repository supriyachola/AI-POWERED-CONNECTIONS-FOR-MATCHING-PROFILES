 AI-Powered Video Conferencing & Matching System 🎥🔍

📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered real-time video conferencing system that intelligently matches users based on shared interests. Using Machine Learning, WebSockets, OpenCV, and Flask, the system ensures seamless video, audio, and text communication.

🔹 AI-based Profile Matching – Uses Word2Vec & scikit-learn for smart interest-based recommendations.
🔹 Real-Time Communication – Integrated video, audio, and text chat with WebSockets.
🔹 Lightweight & Scalable – Backend powered by Flask & SQLite for efficient data management.
🔹 Adaptive Learning – Improves match accuracy based on user interactions over time.

📌 Features
✅ AI-Powered User Matching – Leverages Word2Vec for intelligent interest-based recommendations.
✅ Live Video & Audio Conferencing – Uses OpenCV and Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication.
✅ Text Chat Support – Integrated messaging system for seamless discussions.
✅ User Authentication – Secure SQLite-based login and registration system.
✅ Multi-Modal Communication – Supports text, voice, and video-based interactions.
